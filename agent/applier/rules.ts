  In the details field, provide a brief description of what you see on the page.
  
  IMPORTANT: If the page content appears to be in a language other than English, and you can see a Google Translate option or language selector, mention this in the details field so the automation can click on it to translate the page to English.
  
  Example responses:

  You are on a sign-in page. Determine if you can sign in using just an email address (no password required).
  You have the following email: ${signinDetails.email}
  You have the following default password: ${signinDetails.defaultPassword}
  You have the following LinkedIn password: ${signinDetails.linkedinPassword}
  If the page indicates you can sign in with just an email (e.g. "Continue with email", "Email only", "No password required"), return:
  {canSignInWithEmailOnly: true, email: "the email to use"}

  If the page requires both email and password, and you see fields for both, return:
  {canSignInWithEmailOnly: false, email: "the email to use", password: "the password to use"}

  If the page is specifically for LinkedIn sign-in (e.g. LinkedIn logo, URL contains linkedin.com), return:
  {canSignInWithEmailOnly: false, email: "the email to use", password: "the LinkedIn password to use"}

  If you cannot determine how to sign in, return:
  {canSignInWithEmailOnly: false, email: null, password: null}

  IMPORTANT: Only return valid JSON with the exact fields specified above. Do not include any additional text or explanation.

export const submtApplicationRules = `Complete the job application submission by following these steps in order:

      1. FIRST - Look for and click any of these submission buttons (in order of preference):
         ‚Ä¢ "Submit Application" or "Submit"
         ‚Ä¢ "Apply Now" or "Apply" 
         ‚Ä¢ "Send Application"
         ‚Ä¢ "Complete Application"
         ‚Ä¢ "Finish" or "Done"
         ‚Ä¢ "Continue" or "Next" (if it's the final step)
         ‚Ä¢ "Proceed" or "Confirm"

      2. BUTTON IDENTIFICATION - The button should be:
         ‚Ä¢ Prominently placed (usually bottom right or center)
         ‚Ä¢ Primary colored (blue, green, or brand color)
         ‚Ä¢ NOT disabled/grayed out
         ‚Ä¢ May have icons like ‚û§ ‚Üí ‚úì or similar

      3. HANDLE DIFFERENT SCENARIOS:
         ‚Ä¢ If you see a confirmation dialog, click "Yes" or "Confirm"
         ‚Ä¢ If asked "Are you sure?", click "Yes" or "Submit"
         ‚Ä¢ if there is an agreement/terms checkbox, check it first
         ‚Ä¢ If there's a terms/privacy checkbox that's unchecked, check it first
         ‚Ä¢ If the button is disabled, check for missing required fields or errors

      4. AVOID CLICKING:
         ‚Ä¢ "Cancel", "Back", "Previous", "Save Draft"
         ‚Ä¢ Social media share buttons
         ‚Ä¢ "Edit" or "Modify" buttons
         ‚Ä¢ Navigation buttons that don't submit

      5. MULTI-LANGUAGE SUPPORT - Also look for these international variants:
         ‚Ä¢ "Enviar" (Spanish), "Soumettre" (French), "Absenden" (German)
         ‚Ä¢ "ÈÄÅ‰ø°" (Japanese), "Êèê‰∫§" (Chinese), "–û—Ç–ø—Ä–∞–≤–∏—Ç—å" (Russian)
         ‚Ä¢ "Invio" (Italian), "Verzenden" (Dutch), "Skicka" (Swedish)

      6. IF NO OBVIOUS SUBMIT BUTTON - Look for:
         ‚Ä¢ Buttons with icons: ‚û§, ‚Üí, ‚úì, üì§
         ‚Ä¢ The most prominent call-to-action button
         ‚Ä¢ Buttons that are highlighted or have focus

      Be precise and only click the button that will actually submit/complete the application.
